* [Brain Extraction comparing Segment Anything Model (SAM) and FSL Brain Extraction Tool](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.04738.pdf)(2023/04/15)

This paper compares the Segment Anything Model (SAM) with FSL's Brain Extraction Tool (BET) for brain extraction on different brain scans. Results show that SAM outperforms BET in various evaluation parameters, especially with signal inhomogeneities, non-isotropic voxel resolutions, or lesions near the brain's outer regions and meninges. SAM's superior performance suggests its potential as a more accurate, robust, and versatile tool for brain extraction and segmentation applications.

* [SAM Struggles in Concealed Scenes--Empirical Study on" Segment Anything"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.06022.pdf)(2023/04/15)

In this report, three concealed scenes (camouflaged animals, industrial defects, and medical lesions) have been tested to evaluate SAM's performance under unprompted settings. The main observation is that SAM struggles to accurately identify objects in these scenes.

* [Segment Anything Is Not Always Perfect: An Investigation of SAM on Different Real-world Applications](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.05750.pdf)(2023/04/13)

This work investigates the performance of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) pre-trained on SA-1B across various applications, such as natural images, agriculture, manufacturing, remote sensing, and healthcare. The benefits and limitations of SAM are analyzed and discussed, with an outlook on future development of segmentation tasks. This provides a comprehensive view of SAM in practice, which will facilitate future research activities.
